Metalspoon is a desktop cooking assistant with an organised interface for cooking and features to help make meal plans, grocery lists, and finding new recipes.

The recipe archive works from locally based markdown files, while grocery lists and mealplans work from locally based JSON files. There is no built in support for cloud-based syncing at the moment but this can be easily done by sharing the raw markdown and JSON files to other devices with Metalspoon.
